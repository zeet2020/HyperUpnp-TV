<p align="center">
  <b>A fork of <a href="https://github.com/varbhat/hyperupnp">Hyper UPnP</a> optimized for Fire TV Stick.</b>
  <br><br>
  UI has been updated and streamlined for a better TV experience. Features were removed to simplify usage on TV. with the help of Gemini 3 Pro and my limited knowledge of Java/Kotlin :). 
  <br>
  Feel free to clone and make changes as you like.
